    <h2>Goals for This Lab</h2>
    <p>By the time you have completed this work, you should be able to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Define objects which internally hold arrays</li>
      <li>Write programs which iterate over arrays to produce single values, using loops</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Provided files:</b>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="SumMinMaxArgs.java"><code>SumMinMaxArgs.java</code></a></li>
      <li><a href="SumMinMaxArgsTest.java"><code>SumMinMaxArgsTest.java</code></a></li>
      <li><a href="collaborators.txt"><code>collaborators.txt</code></a></li>
    </ul>
	
	<b>Rubric (126 points):</b>
    <ul>
      <li>SumMinMaxArgs.java - Sum:   		<b>42</b></li>
	  <li>SumMinMaxArgs.java - Min:   		<b>42</b></li>
	  <li>SumMinMaxArgs.java - Max:   		<b>42</b></li>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
	<br/>
    <h4><b>Step 1: Get <a href="OperationsBetween.java"><code>OperationsBetween.java</code></a> Compiling</b></h4>
    <p>
      Download the <a href="OperationsBetween.java"><code>OperationsBetween.java</code></a> file, and open it in jGrasp (or a text editor of your choice).
      This program takes two command-line arguments representing the minimum and maximum number in a numeric range.
      Currently, the code does not compile. As a first step, you need to get this code to compile.
      To this end, you'll need to implement the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Instance variables</li>
      <li>Constructor</li>
      <li>
        A &ldquo;stub&rdquo; for the <code>sum</code> method, which will allow the call to <code>sum</code> in the <code>main</code> method to compile.
        A stub has already been written for the <code>product</code> method; you should write something similar for <code>sum</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once the code has the above elements and is compiling, you're ready to move on to the next step.
    </p>
    <br/>
	
    <h4><b>Step 2: Implement the <code>sum</code> Method</b></h4>
   <p>
      In the previous step, you wrote a stub for <code>sum</code> to get the code compiling.
      Now replace the code in the stub with a loop that will compute the sum between <code>min</code> and <code>max</code>.
      You will need to use a loop for this purpose, and a <code>for</code> loop is likely the best fit.
      You should start from <code>min</code>, and then iterate up to <code>max</code>, using a temporary variable that you increment along the way.
      You will also need another variable to store the result.
      Comments in the file contain further details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once <code>sum</code> (and only <code>sum</code>) is correctly implemented, you should see the following output if run with the command-line arguments <code>3 4</code>:
    </p>
<pre>
Sum: 7
Product: 1
</pre>
    <p></p>
	<br/>
	
    <h4><b>Step 3: Implement the <code>product</code> Method</b></h4>
    <p>
      Replace the code in the stub for <code>product</code> with a loop that will compute the product between <code>min</code> and <code>max</code>.
      This code should look <i>very</i> similar to the code you wrote for <code>sum</code>.
      Further details are in the file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once both <code>product</code> and <code>sum</code> are correctly implemented, you should see the following output if run with the command-line arguments <code>5 8</code>:
    </p>
<pre>
Sum: 26
Product: 1680
</pre>
    <p>
      Further example output is shown below for the command-line arguments <code>3 2</code> (note that the minimum end of the range is greater than the maximum end of the range):
    </p>
<pre>
Sum: 0
Product: 1
</pre>
    <p>
      Further example output is shown below for the command-line arguments <code>3 3</code> (the minimum end of the range is equal to the maximum end of the range):
    </p>
<pre>
Sum: 3
Product: 3
</pre>
    <p></p>
	<br/>
	
    <h4><b>Step 4: Run the Tests in <a href="OperationsBetweenTest.java"><code>OperationsBetweenTest.java</code></a></b></h4>
    <p>
      Download the <a href="OperationsBetweenTest.java"><code>OperationsBetweenTest.java</code></a> file, being sure to put it in the same 
	  folder/directory as your <code>OperationsBetween.java</code> file. This file contains tests for the code you wrote in the previous steps.
      Open this file in jGrasp as a test file, using the <a href="../../resources/jgrasp_junit_configure/index.html#usage">same instructions you've used in previous labs</a>.
      This time around, you do not need to write any of your own tests, though you are free to do so if you desire.
      All of the provided tests should pass.
    </p>
	<br/>
	
	<h4><b>Step 5: Turn in Your Solution Using <a href="https://canvas.csun.edu">Canvas</a></b></h4>
	<p>
      Log into <a href="https://canvas.csun.edu">Canvas</a>, and go to the COMP 110L class.
      Click &ldquo;Assignments&rdquo; on the left pane, then click &ldquo;Lab 14&rdquo;.
      From here, you can upload your answers and your code. Specifically, you must turn in the following file:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>OperationsBetween.java</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition, if you collaborated with anyone else, be sure to download <a href="collaborators.txt"><code>collaborators.txt</code></a> 
	  and write the names of the people you collaborated with in the file, one per line.
      Please submit this file along with the other file.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can turn in the assignment multiple times, but only the last version you submitted will be graded.
