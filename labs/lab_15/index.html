    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
	<br/>
    <h4><b>Step 1: Edit <a href="AllEqual.java"><code>AllEqual.java</code></a></b></h4>
    <p>
      Download the <a href="AllEqual.java"><code>AllEqual.java</code></a> file, and open it in jGrasp (or a text editor of your choice).
      This program takes a number of command line arguments, converts them to integers, and then determines if they all have the same value.
      An example run of the program is below, using the command-line arguments <code>1 2 3</code>:
    </p>
<pre>
Are equal: false
</pre>
    <p>
      A further example is shown below, with the command-line arguments <code>2 2</code>:
    </p>
<pre>
Are equal: true
</pre>
    <p>
      In the event that the program is given no arguments or only one argument, it should consider all the elements equal to each other.
    </p>
    <br/>
	
    <h4><b>Step 2: Open <a href="AllEqualTest.java"><code>AllEqualTest.java</code></a> as a Test File</b></h4>
    <p>
      Download the <a href="AllEqualTest.java"><code>AllEqualTest.java</code></a> file, being sure to put it in the same folder/directory as your <code>AllEqual.java</code> file.
      This file contains tests for the method you wrote in the previous step.
      Open this file in jGrasp as a test file, using the <a href="../../resources/jgrasp_junit_configure/index.html#usage">same instructions you've used in previous labs</a>.
      You do not need to submit these tests, and you are not required to write any of your own tests for this portion.
      However, <b>for full credit, all the tests must pass</b>.
    </p>
	<br/>
	
    <h4><b>Step 3: Edit <a href="AddValueToArray.java"><code>AddValueToArray.java</code></a></b></h4>
    <p>
      Download the <a href="AddValueToArray.java"><code>AddValueToArray.java</code></a> file, and open it in jGrasp (or a text editor of your choice).
      This program will add a given value (passed as a command-line argument) to a given array.
      For simplicity, the array used is &ldquo;hard-coded&rdquo; in <code>main</code>, though the method you write should work with any array.
      Example output for the program is shown below, with the command-line argument <code>5</code>:
    </p>
<pre>
8
13
11
9
</pre>
    <p>
      Each line of the above output corresponds to a single element of the array, starting from index <code>0</code>.
    </p>
	<br/>
	
    <h4><b>Step 5: Edit <a href="AddValueNewArray.java"><code>AddValueNewArray.java</code></a></b></h4>
    <p>
      Download the <a href="AddValueNewArray.java"><code>AddValueNewArray.java</code></a> file, and open it in jGrasp (or a text editor of your choice).
      This program behaves similarly to the <code>AddValueToArray</code> program from before.
      However, instead of modifying the array in-place, it will return a <b>new</b> array holding the modification.
      The original array does not change.
      For simplicity, the array used is &ldquo;hard-coded&rdquo; in <code>main</code>, though the method you write should work with any array.
      Example output with the command-line argument <code>3</code> is shown below:
    </p>
<pre>
Original array:
3
8
6
4
New array:
6
11
9
7
</pre>
    <p>
      Note that the output shows the original, unchanged array, along with the new array.
    </p>
	<br/>
	
	<h4><b>Step 6: Open <a href="AddValueNewArrayTest.java"><code>AddValueNewArrayTest.java</code></a> as a Test File</b></h4>
    <p>
      Download the <a href="AddValueNewArrayTest.java"><code>AddValueNewArrayTest.java</code></a> file, being sure to put it in the same folder/directory as your <code>AddValueNewArray.java</code> file.
      This file contains tests for the method you wrote in the previous step.
      Open this file in jGrasp as a test file, using the <a href="../../resources/jgrasp_junit_configure/index.html#usage">same instructions you've used in previous labs</a>.
      You do not need to submit these tests, and you are not required to write any of your own tests for this portion.
      However, <b>for full credit, all the tests must pass</b>.
    </p>
	<br/>
	
	<h4><b>Step 7: Edit <a href="Take.java"><code>Take.java</code></a></b></h4>
    <p>
      Download the <a href="Take.java"><code>Take.java</code></a> file, and open it in jGrasp (or a text editor of your choice).
      This program will &ldquo;take&rdquo; a given number of elements from a given array, using the command-line arguments as an array, and the hard-coded value of 
	  <code>3</code> elements to take.
      Example output of this program with the command-line arguments <code>foo bar baz</code> is shown below:
    </p>
<pre>
foo
bar
baz
</pre>
    <p>
      In the above example, three elements were taken.
      However, it's possible that we may request to take more elements than we have.
      In such a case, we should take as many as possible.
      For example, consider the program output below when given the command-line arguments <code>foo bar</code>:
    </p>
<pre>
foo
bar
</pre>
    <p>
      In this case, we were only given two arguments, so we cannot take the full three requested.
      As such, all the arguments we <i>could</i> take are shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a third example, we might have more arguments than what we want to take, in which case we only take as many arguments as requested.
      Example output illustrating such a case is shown below, with the command-line arguments <code>alpha beta gamma delta epsilon</code>:
    </p>
<pre>
alpha
beta
gamma
</pre>
    <p>
      In the above example, even though we were given more than three arguments, <code>main</code> is hard-coded to take only three.
      As such, only three are taken, specifically the first three.
    </p>
	<br/>
	
	<h4><b>Step 8: Open <a href="TakeTest.java"><code>TakeTest.java</code></a> as a Test File</b></h4>
    <p>
      Download the <a href="TakeTest.java"><code>TakeTest.java</code></a> file, being sure to put it in the same folder/directory as your <code>Take.java</code> file.
      This file contains tests for the method you wrote in the previous step.
      Open this file in jGrasp as a test file, using the <a href="../../resources/jgrasp_junit_configure/index.html#usage">same instructions you've used in previous labs</a>.
      You do not need to submit these tests, and you are not required to write any of your own tests for this portion.
      However, <b>for full credit, all the tests must pass</b>.
    </p>
	<br/>
	
	<h4><b>Step 9: Turn in Your Solution Using <a href="https://canvas.csun.edu">Canvas</a></b></h4>
	<p>
      Log into <a href="https://canvas.csun.edu">Canvas</a>, and go to the COMP 110L class.
      Click &ldquo;Assignments&rdquo; on the left pane, then click &ldquo;Lab 15&rdquo;.
      From here, you can upload your answers and your code. Specifically, you must turn in the following four files:
    </p>
    <ul>
       <li><code>AllEqual.java</code></li>
      <li><code>AddValueToArray.java</code></li>
      <li><code>AddValueNewArray.java</code></li>
      <li><code>Take.java</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition, if you collaborated with anyone else, be sure to download <a href="collaborators.txt"><code>collaborators.txt</code></a> 
	  and write the names of the people you collaborated with in the file, one per line.
      Please submit this file along with the other file.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can turn in the assignment multiple times, but only the last version you submitted will be graded.
