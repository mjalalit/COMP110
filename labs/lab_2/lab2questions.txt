Lab 2 Questions: Define the Types of Various Expressions

Each of the following questions asks you to provide the type
of the given expression.
The expression is enclosed in backticks (``).
The only possible types for these questions are "int" and "String".

To be clear, "String" and "string" denote different types, as do
"int" and "Int".  As such, using "string" instead of "String"
will be treated as an incorrect answer.

Be sure to provide your answer on the line IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING
the prompt.
