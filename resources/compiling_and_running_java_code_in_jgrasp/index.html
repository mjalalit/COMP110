    <h1>Compiling and Running Java Code with jGRASP</h1>
    <p>
      This guide assumes that you already have jGRASP installed, which is preinstalled on the lab machines.
      jGRASP can be downloaded <a href="http://www.jgrasp.org/">here</a> (look for the &ldquo;Download&rdquo; link on the top left; you can skip
	  the survey and scroll straight to the bottom).
    </p>

    <h2>Step 1: Launch jGRASP</h2>
    <p>
      Exactly how you do this depends on your particular configuration.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 2: Create a New Java Source Filke</h2>
    <p>
      You can create a new Java source file by selecting <code>File -&gt; New -&gt; Java</code>.
      An illustrative image is provided below.

    <h2>Step 3: Write Your Code</h2>
    <p>
      When you ask jGRASP to create a new file, an embedded window will appear wherein you can write and edit your code.
      An illustrative image is provided below.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 4: Save Your Code to a File</h2>
    <p>
      While you have been working with a file in jGRASP, it has not yet been saved to the computer.
      You will need to save the file explicitly before you can actually compile or run your code.
      You can save the file by selecting <code>File -&gt; Save</code> from the menu, as shown in the image below.
    </p>

    <p>
      Selecting <code>Save</code> will allow you to choose exactly where you want to save the file, along with what the filename should be.
      In Java, the filename must <b>always</b> match the name of the class you have created in the file.
      For example, if the class name is <code>Foo</code>, then the code must be saved in a file named <code>Foo.java</code>.
      While you can save your code with a different filename, you won't actually be able to compile and run your code later.
      Assuming your code contains a class definition (e.g., <code>public class Foo</code>), jGRASP will automatically choose a correct filename 
	  (in this case, <code>Foo.java</code>).
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you have selected a place to save the file along with the filename, hit the <code>Save</code> button.
      An illustrative image is shown below.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 5: Compile Your Code</h2>
    <p>
      Once your code is written, you can try to compile it.
      Internally, jGRASP performs this by running <code>javac</code>, though it hides this detail from you.
      You can tell jGRASP to compile your code by selecting <code>Build -&gt; Compile</code>, as shown in the image below.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that compilation won't necessarily succeed.
      For example, the compiler will reject your code if it has a syntax error, which includes things like forgetting to match a left brace 
	  (<code>{</code>) with a right brace (<code>}</code>).
      If compilation doesn't succeed, error messages will be shown in the window at the bottom, illustrated in the image below.
      In the case of the image below, there were no errors; it shows that <code>javac</code> was run and subsequently exited normally.
      Because <code>javac</code> was successful, a class file was produced, namely <code>HelloWorld.class</code>.
      The image below also shows that <code>HelloWorld.class</code> has appeared in the same folder/directory as <code>HelloWorld.java</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 6: Run Your Code</h2>
    <p>
      If your code compiled successfully in the previous step, then you'll be able to run it.
      You can run your code by selecting <code>Build -&gt; Run</code>, as illustrated in the image below.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can see the output of your code in the window at the bottom, in the same location you looked for compiler errors in the previous step.
      This is shown in the image below.
      Be sure to look at the output to make sure your code produced what was expected; oftentimes we don't get it right the first time!
